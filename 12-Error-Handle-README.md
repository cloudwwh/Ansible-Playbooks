Error Handling 

1. limit Flag:

When playbook fail to execute on any host, a file is created containing names of each host where the playbook failed. This file may be 
used with --limit flag to execute only against hosts where the playbook failed. Ansible may be configured to continue execution even
after an error occurs using the 'ignore_errors' keyword.Ansible allows failure conditions to be defined using the 'failed_when' keyword.
There is also 'changed_when' that allows an override of what Ansible considers changed

Example:

ansible-playbook site.yml --limit datacenter2

ansible-playbook site.yml --limit @retry_hosts.txt

ansible-playbook site.yml â€“limit @site.retry

TRY:

ansible-playbook -i inv error1.yml

In error1.yml, change the parameter from alliswell to allisnotwell and run it again to pass the execution

To retry using limit flag
-------------------------

ansible-playbook -i inv error1.yml --limit @error1.retry   (error1.retry is autogenerated)
